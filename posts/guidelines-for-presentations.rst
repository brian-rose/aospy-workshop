As discussed in our `hackpad <https://aospy.hackpad.com>`_ brainstorming
session, a major goal of our workshop is to learn what each other is doing in
order to most efficiently collaborate on building the software tools we need
and avoid duplicating effort. This is the rationale for having individual
presentations.

Presentations should be *15 minutes long* with *5 minutes for questions*. Your
presentation may cover whatever aspect of your work you feel is most relevant
to the `goals of the workshop <https://aospy.hackpad.com/Summary-of-1st-brainstorming-round-lLJ3vXhCk7Z>`_.
For example, you might present an overview of the xarray-based python package
you have developed for analyzing GCM output. Or you could talk about a
particular computational challenge you want to solve to reach your
scientific aims.

Here are some suggestions to make the most out of our individual presentations.

- Keep in mind that we have an *audience with many different backgrounds* at
  this workshop, from atmospheric scientists, to oceanographers, to hydrologists,
  to physicists-turned-software-developers. Within these categories, experience
  levels also vary widely. Keep your presentation simple, clearly introducing
  unfamiliar concepts, acronyms, jargon, etc.
- If you present on an analysis package, clearly state *what problem your
  software aims to solve*. If you present on a specific model or scientific
  problem, clearly state *what obstacles you face* in accomplishing your
  scientific goals.
- Upload your presentation to the web somewhere
  (e.g. `slideshare <http://www.slideshare.net/>`_) so others can easily
  review it.

You may prepare your presentation in powerpoint, keynote, PDF format, or
online slideshow. We will try to load all the presentations onto one laptop
to save time, but since the workshop is small, we will be flexible about this.
